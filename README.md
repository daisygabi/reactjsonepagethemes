# A collection of React.JS one page themes.
From design to code.

## What is this all about
This project containes submodules from other personal and public repositories with React.Js one page themes. All of them are added as submodules in this repository and to see live demo for them, you need to check each project individually. The live demos are hosted for free on Netlify.

## Want to recommend a design from dribbble.com?
I am always looking out for greate website designs and I do like to browse on dribbble.com awesome platform. If there is a design you want to *suggest* that I should give it a go and make it into a React.Js one page theme, create an issue here with `reason why you like the design` and `url from dribble.com to exact image`. 

Obviously, implemeting a design is not garanteed. If I like the idea and have time, I will give it a go and add a new MIT theme here with it.
